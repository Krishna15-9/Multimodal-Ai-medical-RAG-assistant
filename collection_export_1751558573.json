{"documents": ["A Biochemical View on Intermittent Fasting's Effects on Human Physiology-Not Always a Beneficial Strategy. SUMMARY: Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a widely practiced dietary regimen, increasingly utilized in both clinical and non-clinical settings for its potential health benefits. Evidence suggests that IF can improve metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and aiding weight management. Recent studies have also explored its role in mitigating obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and its ability to support cardiovascular health and mental function. The effects of IF, however, vary depending on individual health conditions. Some patients show no clinical improvement, while others experience worsened outcomes. Mechanistically, IF induces metabolic switching and activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), both of which contribute to its therapeutic potential. These responses are influenced by factors such as underlying pathology, baseline metabolic state, and dietary composition. While preclinical data indicate potential therapeutic effects in diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative conditions, these findings are not yet sufficiently supported by human studies. This review argues that IF holds promise as a disease-modifying intervention. However, its implementation should be personalized according to patient-specific characteristics, and future clinical trials must prioritize identifying optimal fasting protocols to maximize therapeutic outcomes.", "Dietary switch and intermittent fasting ameliorate the disrupted postprandial short-chain fatty acid response in diet-induced obese mice. BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting holds promise as a prevention for obesity, but its effects on established obesity remain uncertain.\nMETHODS: We examined two intermittent fasting regimens in diet-induced obese mice, either maintained on a hypercaloric diet or switched to normal chow diet, and compared their effects with those of dietary switch alone (12 mice/group). We assessed metabolic parameters, gut microbiota composition, and fasting and postprandial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels. Additionally, faecal microbiota was analysed before and after diet-induced weight loss in 18 individuals with obesity.\nFINDINGS: Intermittent fasting with a hypercaloric diet effectively mitigated weight gain and improved metabolic health-glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) to an extent comparable with dietary switch. Intermittent fasting increased faecal SCFAs levels, especially postprandially (acetate, propionate, and butyrate, p < 0.05), mirroring dietary switch. Combining intermittent fasting with dietary switch yielded the greatest improvement in glucose tolerance (p < 0.01) and exerted a more pronounced effect on gut microbiota composition (28 significant genera), albeit with reduced SCFA changes. The relative abundance of Alistipes finegoldii was associated with postprandial SCFAs levels and/or metabolic parameters in both mice and humans.\nINTERPRETATION: Intermittent fasting on a hypercaloric diet protects against obesity, while combining intermittent fasting with dietary switch improves glucose metabolism independently of body weight. Both effects are associated with specific microbiota changes and postprandial SCFA dynamics, highlighting the connection between intermittent fasting, microbiota, and metabolic health.\nFUNDING: Supported by the Institute of Health \"Carlos III\", Ministry of Science and Innovation and \"La Caixa\" Foundation.", "Dietary Recommendations from the Moroccan Society for Rheumatology (SMR) for Patients with Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases. SUMMARY: This work was conducted under the auspices of the Moroccan Society of Rheumatology (SMR) with the aim of developing best practice medical guidelines for the dietary management of patients with Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases (IRDs). A working group composed of rheumatology experts and two nutritionists was formed. This group relied on a synthesis of the literature and expert opinions. These guidelines were then validated by a group of rheumatology experts. The methodology followed the procedure proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Five general principles and eleven recommendations were established. These principles emphasise that diet should complement, rather than replace, pharmacological treatment and should be integrated into the overall management of patients with IRDs. Additionally, it should be associated with appropriate physical activity and take cultural and socio-economic context into account. These recommendations highlight the importance of weight loss for overweight or obese patients and advocate for the Mediterranean diet as well as a diet rich in omega-3. However, exclusion diets such as gluten-free, vegetarian, and dairy-free diets, as well as supplementation with probiotics or spices, are currently not recommended for patients with IRDs. Supplementation with vitamins or trace elements is not systematically recommended, and the data concerning Ramadan fasting or intermittent fasting are limited or contradictory. Furthermore, two specific recommendations for the Moroccan diet were proposed. These recommendations standardise dietary management in IRDs, making it accessible for practitioners and patients.", "Intermittent fasting for weight loss in night shift workers: a three-arm, superiority randomised clinical trial. BACKGROUND: Weight gain and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes are recognised consequences of night shift work. We tested the effectiveness of two modified intermittent fasting (IF) strategies compared with continuous energy restriction (CER) on weight loss and improvements in insulin resistance in night shift workers.\nMETHODS: A parallel group, three-arm randomised superiority clinical trial (Melbourne and Adelaide) recruited night shift workers (aged \u2265 25 and \u2264 65 years) with overweight/obesity. Participants were randomised by minimisation (site, age, gender) 1:1:1 to CER or one of two modified IF strategies. For 24 weeks participants followed a diet of 2100 kJ/d for two days of the week (modified IF) either on days off/day shift (IF:2D) or whilst on night shift (IF:2N) and followed their usual diet on the remaining five days. Co-primary outcomes were body weight and insulin resistance measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) at 24-weeks. Participants and those assessing weight outcomes were not blinded to group assignment. Researchers assessing biochemical outcomes and study statistician were blinded to group assignment. Between-group differences were calculated using mixed-effects regression models.\nFINDINGS: From October 2019 to February 2022, 250 participants (CER = 85; IF:2D = 83; IF:2N = 82) were randomised (mean (SD) age 46.8 (9.8) years; 133 women (53.2%)), with 170 (68%) completing. No significant difference between either modified IF strategy and CER for body weight; IF:2D vs CER (mean difference (MD) = -0.2 kg [95% CI -6.4 to 5.9]) and IF:2N vs CER (MD = -0.6 kg [95% CI -6.8 to 5.6]) and insulin resistance; IF:2D vs CER (MD = -0.1 [95% CI -1.0 to 0.8]) and IF:2N vs CER (MD = -0.3 [95% CI -0.5 to 1.2]) were observed. For secondary outcomes, those randomised to IF:2D had lower total and LDL cholesterol compared to CER ((MD = -23.2 mg/dL [95% CI -34.8 to -11.6]) and (MD = -19.3 mg/dL [95% CI -30.9 to -7.7]) respectively). In a completer's analysis, favourable changes in body weight, insulin resistance, body composition, blood pressure, and cardiometabolic markers were observed within all groups. No serious trial related adverse events were reported.\nINTERPRETATION: At 24 weeks, weight and HOMA-IR were not different between the modified IF groups compared with CER. Clinically significant improvements in weight and metabolic health were achieved for the majority of night shift workers who remained in the intervention at 24 weeks.\nFUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1159762).

BACKGROUND: Visceral adiposity is closely linked with cardiometabolic disorders, but evidence on the extent of visceral fat loss required for significant improvement in cardiometabolic markers remains limited. This study aims to investigate the association between visceral fat area (VFA) reductions and improvements in cardiometabolic markers following a 3-month dietary intervention.\nMETHODS: A total of 175 adults with overweight and obesity were involved in this non-randomized controlled trial. Data on sociodemographic, anthropometric, body composition and biochemistry were collected at baseline and after 3 months of intervention. The multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between VFA loss (no loss, < 5% loss, and \u2265 5% loss) and improvement in cardiometabolic markers. For each cardiometabolic marker, an improvement surpassing the minimum threshold of the third tertile was classified as a good improvement.\nRESULTS: Compared to those with no VFA loss, participants with VFA loss of \u2265 5% were significantly associated with a higher improvement in waist circumference (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16-7.64), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.58-11.14), triglycerides (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.14-7.92), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.12-7.79). Other than that, those with < 5% VFA loss were 3.6 times more likely to have a higher improvement in HDL-C compared to those with no VFA loss (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.36-12.22).\nCONCLUSION: This study found that the magnitude of VFA loss is an independent determinant of improvements in cardiometabolic markers and should be set as a clear target when designing obesity prevention programs.", "Additional Effect of Exercise to Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Health in Adults With Overweight/obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additional effect of exercise to intermittent fasting (IF) on body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults with overweight/obesity.\nMETHOD: Relevant studies were identified through a systematic search across five databases. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on outcomes including body composition and cardiometabolic health markers, to compare the effect of combining IF with exercise against IF alone. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach, while the quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the TESTEX scale.\nRESULT: In total, twelve studies including 616 participants (Age: 40\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0years; BMI: 33.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\u00a0kg/m\nCONCLUSION: The potential benefits of incorporating exercise into IF for adults with overweight/obesity, particularly in terms of body composition, glycemic control, and cardiorespiratory fitness, appear promising. Nevertheless, given the limited amount of data, future investigations are essential to strengthen the evidence base and investigate the influence of specific exercise and IF types in enhancing treatment outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of intermittent fasting diets, with continuous energy restriction or unrestricted (ad-libitum) diets on intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes from randomised clinical trials.\nDESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.\nDATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and central databases from inception to 14 November 2024.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised clinical trials comparing the association of intermittent fasting diets (alternate day fasting, time restricted eating, and whole day fasting), continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets were included.\nMAIN OUTCOMES: Outcomes included body weight (primary) and measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and markers of liver disease.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: A network meta-analysis based on a frequentist framework was performed with data expressed as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).\nRESULTS: 99 randomised clinical trials involving 6582 adults of varying health conditions (720 healthy, 5862 existing health conditions) were identified. All intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction diet strategies reduced body weight when compared with ad-libitum diet. Compared with continuous energy restriction, alternate day fasting was the only form of intermittent fasting diet strategy to show benefit in body weight reduction (mean difference -1.29 kg (95% CI -1.99 to -0.59), moderate certainty of evidence). Additionally, alternate day fasting showed a trivial reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg (-2.49 to -0.88) and -1.05 kg (-1.90 to -0.19), respectively, both with moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up (n=76); however, moderate-to-long-term trials (\u226524 weeks, n=17) only showed benefits in weight reduction in diet strategies compared with ad-libitum. Furthermore, in comparisons between intermittent fasting strategies, alternate day fasting lowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high density lipoprotein compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol. No differences were noted between intermittent fasting, continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets for HbA\nCONCLUSIONS: Minor differences were noted between some intermittent fasting diets and continuous energy restriction, with some benefit of weight loss with alternate day fasting in shorter duration trials. The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05309057.", "Evidence-based review of the nutritional treatment of obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children and adolescents. SUMMARY: The growing pediatric obesity epidemic has paralleled the surge in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It develops due to nutritional imbalances, microbiome dysbiosis, gene regulation, hormonal changes, and environmental factors like food deserts, low activity level, and an unhealthy lifestyle. The prevalence of MASLD and obesity is rising every year. Lifestyle changes remain the mainstay treatment for obesity and MASLD. Per the 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidance on MASLD, achieving \u22655% weight loss can reduce hepatic steatosis, \u22657% weight loss can reduce hepatic inflammation, and \u226510% weight loss can reduce liver fibrosis. Therefore, nutritional interventions can be a powerful tool to help correct metabolic dysfunction and promote healthy weight loss. Current endorsed nutritional interventions for weight loss or MASLD include the Mediterranean diet, low glycemic/low carbohydrate diet, plant-based diet/anti-inflammatory diet, ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting. This review provides evidence-based insights into current nutritional interventions for children and adolescents with obesity and MASLD to help guide pediatric gastroenterologists in making the best dietary-based recommendations in clinical practice.", "The Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Coronary Heart Disease in Patients With Gout: A Cross-Sectional Study. SUMMARY: Background Long-term gout patients have been linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its associated comorbidities. Therefore, careful evaluations are necessary to examine the prevalence and the causes of CHD in gout\u00a0patients. The aim of this research was to identify significant factors associated with CHD in patients with gout along with the prevalence rate. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 270 gout patients who attended the specialist outpatient clinic and the medicine department of Sheikh Zayed Medical College & Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan. Data about predictor variables was collected through interviews and standard clinical procedures. Blood samples were taken to measure laboratory variables such as fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum creatinine,\u00a0cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)\u00a0and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Initially, descriptive statistics along with the chi-square test of association was executed. Finally, logistic regression analysis was performed as a classification method to estimate the odds ratio and confidence interval. Results The findings showed that 108 (40%, n=270) of gout\u00a0patients experienced CHD with the highest prevalence rate (52; 48%, n1=108) of myocardial infarction (MI). Among all (n=270) patients, 150 (56%) were suffering from gout for more than 10 years, and 161 (60%) were diagnosed with hypertension. Considering p-value<0.05 as significant for the chi-square test, hypertension (p-value=0.001), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\u00a0(p-value=0.004), family history of CHD\u00a0(p-value=0.001), serum creatinine (p-value=0.02), cholesterol (p-value=0.04), subcutaneous tophi (p-value=0.02), intraosseous tophi (p-value=0.04), and intermittent allopurinol intake (p-value=0.04) were found to be associated with CHD in patients with gout. The logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension (OR=2.70, CI: 1.60-4.58), T2DM (OR=2.08, CI: 1.26-3.42), creatinine (OR=1.77, CI: 1.07-2.93), cholesterol (OR=1.67, CI: 1.02-2.73), HDL-C\u00a0(OR=0.59, CI: 0.36-0.96), subcutaneous tophi (OR=1.86, CI: 1.09-3.16), intraosseous tophi (OR=2.22, CI: 1.29-3.81), and intermittent allopurinol consumption (OR=1.92, CI: 1.01-3.66) were associated with CHD in patients with gout. Conclusions The study estimated that 40% of patients with chronic gout developed different types of CHD with the highest prevalence of MI, regardless of the duration of gout or treatment of acute attacks. Hypertension, T2DM, obesity, high creatinine,\u00a0high cholesterol, low HDL-C and presence of intraosseous tophi are found to be significant factors of CHD in gout\u00a0patients. These findings significantly contributed to medical research to address the risk of CHD among Pakistani patients with gout by controlling these significant associated factors. Gout\u00a0patients with a positive family history of CHD should also take precautionary measures to avoid heart complications. Nation-wide large-scale analyses considering rural/urban disparities are recommended for more in-depth investigations of influencing factors to prevent cardiovascular complications among patients with gout since diversity in demographic, lifestyle and environmental factors may influence the overall impact. Future analysis with lipids as a continuous variable is also suggested for more accurate estimates."], "metadatas": [{"journal": "Biology", "pubmed_id": "40563920", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "authors": "Willian F Zambuzzi, Marcel Rodrigues Ferreira, Zifan Wang, Maikel P Peppelenbosch", "title": "A Biochemical View on Intermittent Fasting's Effects on Human Physiology-Not Always a Beneficial Strategy.", "article_types": "Journal Article, Review", "year": "2025"}, {"journal": "EBioMedicine", "article_types": "Journal Article", "pubmed_id": "40561776", "year": "2025", "authors": "Vict\u00f2ria Ceperuelo-Mallafr\u00e9, M-Mar Rodr\u00edguez-Pe\u00f1a, Joan Badia, Teresa Villanueva-Carmona, L\u00eddia Ced\u00f3, Anna Marsal-Beltran, Ester Benaiges, Catalina N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Roa, Laura Salmer\u00f3n-Pelado, Francisco J Osuna-Prieto, Ram\u00f3n Bosch, Silvia Pellitero, Sonia Fern\u00e1ndez-Veledo, Joan Vendrell", "title": "Dietary switch and intermittent fasting ameliorate the disrupted postprandial short-chain fatty acid response in diet-induced obese mice.", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7}, {"authors": "Hind El-Kasmi, Samira Rostom, Salma Zemrani, Bouchra Amine, Latifa Tahiri, Nessrine Akasbi, Kawtar Nassar, Soumiya Mehdioui, Sara Wakrim, Racha Lahlou, Nada Bensaoud, Rachina Bahiri", "article_types": "Journal Article", "year": "2025", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "journal": "Mediterranean journal of rheumatology", "title": "Dietary Recommendations from the Moroccan Society for Rheumatology (SMR) for Patients with Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases.", "pubmed_id": "40557185"}, {"pubmed_id": "40554393", "title": "Intermittent fasting for weight loss in night shift workers: a three-arm, superiority randomised clinical trial.", "year": "2025", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "authors": "Maxine P Bonham, Gloria K W Leung, Michelle Rogers, Rochelle Davis, Angela B Clark, Corinne Davis, Yan Yin Phoi, Robert S Ware, Asmaa El-Heneidy, Nicole J Kellow, Jillian Dorrian, Siobhan Banks, Tracey L Sletten, Catherine E Huggins, Alison M Coates", "article_types": "Journal Article", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7}, {"authors": "Shazana Rifham Abdullah, Ahmad Kamil Nur Zati Iwani, Liyana Ahmad Zamri, Ruziana Mona Wan Mohd Zin, Norhashimah Abu Seman, Nur Azlin Zainal Abidin, Siti Sarah Hamzah, Nur Hayati Azizul, Azahadi Omar, Zamtira Seman, Abqariyah Yahya, Mohd Fairulnizal Md Noh", "pubmed_id": "40535330", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "year": "2025", "article_types": "Journal Article", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "title": "Visceral adiposity loss is associated with improvement in cardiometabolic markers: findings from a dietary intervention study."}, {"journal": "Current obesity reports", "authors": "Zi-Han Dai, Ke-Wen Wan, Po-San Wong, Wendy Yajun Huang, Angus Pak-Hung Yu, Stephen Heung-Sang Wong", "pubmed_id": "40533648", "article_types": "Journal Article, Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, Review", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "year": "2025", "title": "Additional Effect of Exercise to Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Health in Adults With Overweight/obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."}, {"journal": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "article_types": "Journal Article, Network Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review", "pubmed_id": "40533200", "year": "2025", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "title": "Intermittent fasting strategies and their effects on body weight and other cardiometabolic risk factors: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials.", "authors": "Zhila Semnani-Azad, Tauseef A Khan, Laura Chiavaroli, Victoria Chen, Hardil Anup Bhatt, Alisia Chen, Nicholas Chiang, Julianah Oguntala, Stefan Kabisch, David Cw Lau, Sean Wharton, Arya M Sharma, Leanne Harris, Lawrence A Leiter, James O Hill, Frank B Hu, Michael Ej Lean, Hana Kahleov\u00e1, Dario Rahelic, Jordi Salas-Salvad\u00f3, Cyril Wc Kendall, John L Sievenpiper"}, {"pubmed_id": "40525381", "authors": "Sara Karjoo, Amy Braglia-Tarpey, Alvin P Chan, Ana Gabriela Ayala Germ\u00e1n, Rachel E Herdes, Nikhil Pai, Desiree Sierra-Velez, Bridget Whitehead, Ruben E Quiros-Tejeira, Debora Duro", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "journal": "Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition", "title": "Evidence-based review of the nutritional treatment of obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children and adolescents.", "article_types": "Journal Article, Review", "year": "2025"}, {"authors": "Sohaib Asghar, Shoaib Asghar, Summayha Mahbub, Asad Riaz, Shahid Farooq, Imran Khan", "title": "The Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Coronary Heart Disease in Patients With Gout: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "article_types": "Journal Article", "year": "2025", "journal": "Cureus", "healthcare_relevance": 0.7, "pubmed_id": "40458383"}]}
